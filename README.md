# Numerical Schr√∂dinger Equations

Repository for the 2018 summer project at Imperial. For now, the following has to
be done:

## To Do
- [x] Create repository
- [ ] Add Vedin and supervisor as collaborators
- [x] Write summary on QM course for supervisor meeting
- [ ] Meet supervisor
- [ ] Formulate goals / road-map
- [ ] Get started

(If you need help using Git, [this](try.github.io) is supposedly a nice tutorial.)
