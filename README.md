# Numerical SchrÃ¶dinger Equations

Repository for the 2018 summer project at Imperial. For now, the following has to
be done:

## To Do
- [x] Create repository
- [x] Add Vedin as collaborator
- [x] Write summary on QM course for supervisor meeting
- [x] Meet supervisor
- [x] Formulate goals / road-map
- [x] Get started
- [x] Verify that the eigenvalues function gives correct values for energy
- [ ] Get double the energy -> investigate...
- [ ] Test on less trivial examples
- [x] Think about optimization to get more energy eigenvalues (current scaling gives lots of values)
- [ ] Start thinking about C implementation

(If you need help using Git, [this](http://try.github.io) is supposedly a nice tutorial.)
