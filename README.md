# Numerical Schr√∂dinger Equations

Repository for the 2018 summer project at Imperial. For now, the following has to
be done:

## To Do
- [x] Create repository
- [x] Add Vedin as collaborator
- [x] Write summary on QM course for supervisor meeting
- [x] Meet supervisor
- [ ] Formulate goals / road-map
- [ ] Get started

(If you need help using Git, [this](http://try.github.io) is supposedly a nice tutorial.)

## Helpful resources

- [Wikipedia article on numerical method we will use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerov%27s_method)

## Research
- [ ] Integration of ODEs (numerical recipes)
- [ ] Numerov
- [ ] Finite potential well
