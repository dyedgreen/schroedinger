# Numerical SchrÃ¶dinger Equations

Repository for the 2018 summer project at Imperial. This implements (and uses) a Python module for
computing numerical values of the energy eigenvalues that a particle can have in a given potential.

## Usage

A simple example of using the module would look like this:

```
from numerov import units
import numerov_c as num

# Test potential (10Amst wide square well, 14eV deep)
def pot(x):
    if x > -1e-9 and x < 1e-9:
        return 0.
    return 14. * units.e

# Settings
l = 20e-10 # Half width of integration range
m = 9.10938e-31 # Electron mass
s = 1000 # Number of integration steps
n = 5 # Number of energy eigenstates to attempt

energies = num.energy(pot, m, -l, l, 0.1, 0.1, s, n)

# Print energies in eV
for en in energies:
    print(units.unscaleE(en) / units.e)
```

For detailed documentations of each function, please see the Python source code in the `numerov` folder.
Each function is documented there. The c module only provides the `energy()` function as seen in the
above example. All c module functions have a signature identical to their Python counterparts.

## Building the C extension

Building the C extension should be super simple. Just run `make install` in the `numerov_c` folder. If
you have Python 3 installed as either `python` or `python3`, you should be good to go.
