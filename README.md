# Numerical Schr√∂dinger Equations

Repository for the 2018 summer project at Imperial. For now, the following has to
be done:

## To Do
- [x] Create repository
- [x] Add Vedin as collaborator
- [x] Write summary on QM course for supervisor meeting
- [x] Meet supervisor
- [X] Formulate goals / road-map
- [X] Get started
- [ ] Verify that the eigenvalues function gives correct values for energy
- [ ] Think about optimization to get more energy eigenvalues
- [ ] Start thinking about C implementation

(If you need help using Git, [this](http://try.github.io) is supposedly a nice tutorial.)
